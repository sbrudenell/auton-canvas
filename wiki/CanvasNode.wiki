= !CanvasNode =

!CanvasNode is the base type for all graphics objects.

!CanvasNodes _are not DOM elements_. they can only live inside !AutonCanvas, attached to a [Group] or directly to a [Canvas]. 

= transformations =

!CanvasNodes can be scaled or moved around, but _not rotated_.

unlike [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/ SVG] elements, !CanvasNodes _don't have a full transformation matrix_. they just have a stored scale and translation.

when rendering, the scale is applied _first_, followed by the translation.

when rendering, transformations on a [Group] or [Canvas] apply recursively to all child elements.

{{{
// scale a path by 2 in both dimensions
path.scale(2, 2);

// move a path 50 units up
path.translateY(-50);

// shift everything in a canvas 100 pixels to the right
canvas.translateX(100);
}}}
