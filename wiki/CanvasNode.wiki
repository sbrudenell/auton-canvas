= !CanvasNode =

!CanvasNode is the base type for all graphics objects.

!CanvasNodes _are not DOM elements_. they can only live inside !AutonCanvas, attached to a [Group] or a [Canvas] directly.

= transformations =

!CanvasNodes can be scaled or moved around, but _not rotated_.

unlike [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/ SVG] elements, !CanvasNodes _don't have a full transformation matrix_. they just have a stored scale and translation.
