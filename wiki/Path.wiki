#summary Overview of Path objects, the most versatile objects in AutonCanvas.

= Path =

[Path Paths] are the most versatile expressive objects in !AutonCanvas. they can draw arbitrary shapes, described by a language modeled on [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData SVG's path language].

= path data =

[Path] data is passed as an `Array` instead of a `String`, contrary to many graphics frameworks. in a data array, a path instruction is followed by a variable number of arguments. for example:

{{{
// a circle, overlapping a square

var data = [
  'M', 0, 0,
  'L', 0, 100,
  'L', 100, 100,
  'L', 100, 0,
  'L', 0, 0,
  'E',
  'R', 100, 100, 50
];
}}}

the above data would draw a circle of radius `50` centered on `100,100`, overlapping a square from `0,0` to `100,100`. note how the `'R'` instruction takes 3 arguments, `'M'` and `'L'` take two, and `'E'` takes none.
