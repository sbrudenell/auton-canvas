#summary everything you ever wanted to know!

== what does this thing do? ==

!AutonCanvas draws simple vector graphics on the web. it's fast, and doesn't need plugins.

== what would i use it for? ==

dynamic visualizations! !AutonCanvas was originally made to replace [http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ JFreeChart] for visualizing large datasets on the web.

it should be possible to implement the flash-based [http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG Google Finance chart widget] entirely using !AutonCanvas.

== are there any real-world usage examples? ==

none that are public yet :)

== how much faster is it, really? ==

i'll have actual speed comparisons up soon!

== i hear _(other library)_ is awesome. why would i want to use !AutonCanvas? ==

there are many featureful frameworks that draw graphics cross-browser with javascript ([http://raphaeljs.com/ Raphael], [http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas]), but they suffer for speed in various situations.

if you need to draw complex graphics quickly, !AutonCanvas is your best bet.

== [http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas] lets me use [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html the canvas element] i know and love. why doesn't !AutonCanvas just do that? ==

excanvas is very slow when drawing even modestly complex scenes in Internet Explorer. using VML as a back-end for the canvas element will always be slow; a more VML-like API is needed for VML to be fast.
