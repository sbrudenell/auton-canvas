#summary everything you ever wanted to know!

== what does this thing do? ==

!AutonCanvas draws simple vector graphics on the web. it's fast, even in IE, and doesn't need plugins.

it uses the HTML5 canvas element or VML.

while speedy, !AutonCanvas is fairly low-level. you can think of it as the C of javascript graphics. :)

== what would i use it for? ==

dynamic visualizations! !AutonCanvas was originally made to replace [http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/ JFreeChart] for visualizing large datasets on the web.

it should be possible to implement the flash-based [http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:GOOG Google Finance chart widget] entirely using !AutonCanvas.

if you need to draw complex graphics (lines with 1000+ features) quickly, !AutonCanvas is your best bet.

== i hear _(other library)_ is awesome. why would i want to use !AutonCanvas? ==

there are many featureful frameworks that draw graphics ([http://raphaeljs.com/ Raphael], [http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas], [http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/gfx dojox gfx]), but they suffer for speed in various situations.

you _should not_ use !AutonCanvas if:

 * you don't need compatibility with IE6-8 (use [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html the canvas element] directly)
 * you don't need fast drawing in IE6-8 (use [http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas])
 * you don't need complex graphics (use [http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojox/gfx dojox gfx] or [http://raphaeljs.com/ Raphael])
 * you require a high-level framework for animations (use [http://raphaeljs.com/ Raphael])
 * you are okay with forcing your users to use flash ([http://flashsucks.org/ don't], if you can help it at all)
 * you are okay with forcing your users to use java (definitely don't. java has all the same problems as flash, but is less supported)

== are there any real-world usage examples? ==

none that are public yet :)

== how much faster is it, really? ==

i'll have actual speed comparisons up soon!

== [http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ excanvas] lets me use [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html the canvas element] i know and love. why doesn't !AutonCanvas just do that? ==

excanvas is very slow when drawing even modestly complex scenes in Internet Explorer. using VML as a back-end for the canvas element will always be slow; a more VML-like API is needed for VML to be fast.

== why are [Basics#transformations transformations] so limited? why not use a transform matrix like everyone else? ==

VML doesn't support a full transform matrix (without significant overhead), just a few simple CSS rules.

VML does support rotation, which may be added in the future. i don't yet have a strong enough use case to justify the extra bugs i would introduce ;).

== [http://raphaeljs.com/ Raphael] gives me DOM elements i'm familiar with. why does !AutonCanvas use [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html the canvas element]? ==

firefox and chrome seem to render the canvas element much faster than the alternative, [http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/ SVG]. speed is the first design goal of !AutonCanvas.
